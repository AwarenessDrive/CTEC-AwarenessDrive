  Awareness is vital to helping young people deal with many of  the challenges they face today.  For  distracted driving (a key contributor to auto accidents which are the #1 cause  of death for youth) awareness is the solution. For other major challenges from  bullying to eating disorders, cutting, substance abuse, even suicide, awareness  is the first step to making things better.   Yet positive awareness can be hard to achieve because of:
  <ul>
    <li>The complexity of issues and information sources  confronting young people today.</li>
    
    <li>Limited resources on the part of schools and  other organizations trying to help.</li>
    
    <li>The difficulty of creating effective messages  for this savvy and complex audience.</li>
    
    <li>Youth resistance to admitting what's going on,  even to themselves.</li>
    
    <li>The riskiness of a &quot;general&quot; web  search around an issue, which can lead youth to sites actually promoting harmful  behavior such as eating disorders or even suicide.</li>
    
  </ul>
  <h3>AwarenessDrives</h3>
  
    <span class="red">AWARENESS</span><span class="grey">drive</span><span class="white">.org</span>
    seeks to promote awareness with specially  created communications campaigns and school-based, school sanctioned events  similar to food/clothing drives that:

    <ul>
    <li>Utilize targeted and tested communications and  social media/online efforts that can be adapted by and tailored to each  participating school and community.</li>
    
    <li>Bring experts, students and schools together to  share awareness, resources, stories and support around a range of issues.</li>
    
    <li>Promote awareness of the online  AwarenessDrive.org &quot;supportal&quot; (See below)</li>
     </ul>
   
    <strong>www.</strong>
    <span class="red">AWARENESS</span><span class="grey">drive</span><span class="white">.org</span>
    is envisioned as a new, safe, website/&quot;supportal&quot; that  would:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Serve as a &quot;411 resource&quot; for those  searching for support, with anonymous easy access to vetted information from  experts, links to organizations serving youth and stories of people who have  dealt with similar challenges.</li>
    
    <li>Maximize the impact and resources of youth  support services and organizations.</li>
    
    <li>Provide access to all AwarenessDrive.org  resources, partners and programs.</li>
    
    <li>Be adaptable by any school or community while  offering youth and those supporting  them a single, easy to remember address for safe support and assistance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Community Of  Awareness</h3>

    <span class="red">AWARENESS</span><span class="grey">drive</span><span class="white">.org</span> 
    is an innovative effort being developed in  cooperation with young people, Boulder County Public Health, Boulder Valley  School District educators and guidance/crisis professionals as well as the  Boulder Public Library and Boulder Bookstore and other Boulder area community  resources and organizations.  It isn't  meant to duplicate work already being done but to create an impactful cost  effective means for young people, educators, experts, public health advocates  and others to share information and support. To help AwarenessDrive.org help  young people gain the awareness they need to deal with the issues that confront  them contact <span class="red">Richard.goode-allen@colorado.edu</span>.<br/>
