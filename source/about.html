<h4>(Founder, AwarenessDrive.org)</h4><br/><br/>

AwarenessDrive.org combines Richard Good-Allen's professional and personal lives, including over 30 years in communications and education and a childhood spent in a family that dealt with a range of the challenges AwarenessDrive addresses, including substance abuse, eating disorders, sexual orientation issues, self-harm, depression, suicide attempts, violence, and more. For over 25 years he's worked at dealing with his own "zombie emotions" and helping others deal with and "recover" from attempts to manage their issues or feelings.

Richard is an adjunct professor at CU in the Advertising program, as well as an active member of Rotary.
